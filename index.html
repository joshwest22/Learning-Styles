<h1>Learning Styles</h1>
    <h2> Commonalites</h2>
    <p>
    Carol Dweck talks about the power of having a growth mindset. She says this entails of 3 key components. Along with the list of those 3 components I have added congruent material from the Vertasium videos.
        <ol><li>Goals</li>
    <ul><li>People in a fixed mindset want to look smart at all cost, while people in a growth mindset want to learn at all costs. In the Vertasium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY_o4A1wzsg">videos</a> there are several people who either make up something that sounds correct to them or more tellingly repeat the same answer and seem confused about the question. These people have a fixed mindset for that question they are being asked. Because their goal is to look smart rather than admit they are unsure, they wind up looking stupid precisely <i>because</i> the way their goal manifests is through the action of avoidance.</li></ul>
    <li>Effort</li>
    <ul><li>People in a fixed mindset believe things should come naturally and if they don't you should avoid that thing so you don't look stupid. However, people in a growth mindset believe that you must work hard and that effort is key. </li> </ul>
    <li>Setbacks</li>
    <ul><li>People in a fixed mindset hide their mistakes and deficiencies, while those with a growth mindset capitalize on mistakes and confront deficiencies as opportunities to grow. This ties to the Veritasium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY_o4A1wzsg">videos</a> he said that telling people the answer is not very helpful because they just reassure themselves of what they already know, essentially using a fixed mindset.</li></ul></ol>
    </p>
    <h2> Different Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
    There were a few unique differences that I took away from each of the videos.
    <ul>
    <li> According to Carol Dweck's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVhUdhZxbGI">video</a>, the more a discipline believed it takes raw ability that can't be taught to be successful in that field, the fewer women and minorities in the discipline.
        <ul><li>This likely means that if this were debunked and shown to people in the relevant populations along with the ingredients for a growth mindset, this discrepancy could be mitigated and hopefully mended.</li></ul></li>
    <li> According to the first Veritasium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KZb2_vcNTg">video</a>, trees get most of their mass from carbon dioxide rather than from soil. ;P</li>
    <li>According to the second Veritasium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY_o4A1wzsg">video</a>, the person easiest to fool is yourself. So be on the look out for your own errors.</li>
    </ul>
